## prerequisite knowledge
- multipitch detection
	- frame level
	- note level
- note level evaluation
	- note attributes
		- pitch
		- onset
		- offset
	- how to measure correct note
		- pitch matches
		- onset is within 50ms of ground truth
		- offset - optional for many systems
- true positives, false positives, false negatives
	- true positive
		- right pitch
		- onset is within 50ms of true onset
	- false positive
		- note that shouldn't exist
	- false negative
		- note in ground truth undetected by the system
- note level metrics
	- precision - how many notes were correct
		- TP / (TP + FP)
	- recall - how many notes are true notes
		- TP (TP + FN)
	- F1 score - harmonic mean of precision and recall
		- 2PR / (P + R)
- onset tolerance - 50ms rule
	- humans perceive notes within 50ms as the same onset
	- amt uses tolerance window
	- exact alignment is unrealistic
- note value (duration) basics
	- note duration is correct if sufficiently close to ground truth duration
