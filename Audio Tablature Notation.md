## Summary
A website that takes in audio files and transcribes them into tablature. The tabs should be in the style of a piano. The user should be able to play back the tabs and listen to a MIDI version generated by the website. It should be able to work with different instruments but the focus will be placed on piano for the sake of simplicity. It should work on chords as well as single notes.
